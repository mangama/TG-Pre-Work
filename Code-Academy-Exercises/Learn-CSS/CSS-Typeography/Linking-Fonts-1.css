Linking Fonts I
With the number of fonts available with modern typography, it is unrealistic to expect users to have all fonts installed on their computers. New fonts are often centralized in directories made available for public use. We refer to these fonts as non-user fonts.

Google Fonts is one such directory of thousands of open-source fonts, available for free use. Google Fonts gives us a way to retrieve the link for a single font, multiple fonts, or multiple fonts with the font-weight and font-style properties.

We'll show you where to add this link in the next exercise.
1. View the video in this exercise.

The video demonstrates how to retrieve the link for a single font, multiple fonts, and multiple fonts of various numeric font weights and font styles.



2. Once you have viewed the video, repeat these steps in the browser on your desktop computer, selecting the Space Mono font specifying both the regular (400) and bold (700) font-weights.

When you are ready, click 'Next' to continue.
