/*
async GET Requests I
Let’s take a minute to appreciate what you’ve accomplished so far:

used fetch() to make GET and POST requests.
check the status of the responses coming back
catch errors that might possibly arise
taking successful responses and rendering it on the webpage
That is fantastic! It’s the basis of how the internet works!

In the following exercises, we’re going to take what you’ve learned about chaining Promises and make it simpler using functionality introduced in ES8: async and await. You read that right, you did the hard part already, now it’s time to make it easier.

The structure for this request will also be slightly different. Notice the new keywords async and await, as well as the try and catch statements.

We’ll be going over how to write the boilerplate code for async GET requests in the next lesson.
