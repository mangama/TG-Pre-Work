/*
fetch() POST Requests I
In the previous exercise, you successfully wrote a GET request using the fetch API and handled Promises to get word suggestions from Datamuse. Give yourself a pat on the back (or two to treat yourself)!

Now, you're going to learn how to use fetch() to construct POST requests!

Take a look at the diagram to the right. It has the boilerplate code for a POST request using fetch().

Notice that the initial call takes two arguments: an endpoint and an object that contains information needed for the POST request. The rest of the request is identical to the GET request.
