/*
async POST Requests I
Now that you’ve made an async GET request, let’s start on getting you familiar the async POST request.

As with the other GET and POST requests that you’ve been making, an async POST request requires more information. Take a look at the diagram.

We still have the same structure of using try and catch as before. But, in the fetch() call, we now have to include an additional argument that contains more information like method and body.

We’ll be explaining the why's and how's of the boilerplate code for async POST requests in the next lesson.
