<!-- Where Does the Title Appear?
Unfortunately, the browser panel used by the Codecademy environment does not have a title bar, so the "Brown Bear" title you wrote in the previous exercise will not be displayed. Outside of the Codecademy environment, however, your title would appear as depicted in the diagram to the right.

So far, we have learned about:

<!DOCTYPE html>, the declaration specifying the version of HTML for the browser
The <html> tags that enclose all of your HTML code
The <head> tag that contains the metadata of a webpage, such as its <title>
Next, you will learn about new types of elements that go inside the body.-->
