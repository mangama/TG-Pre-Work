<!--Indentation:
The World Wide Web Consortium, or W3C, is responsible for maintaining the style
standards of HTML. At the time of writing, the W3C recommends 2 spaces of
indentation when writing HTML code. Although your code will work without
exactly two spaces, this standard is followed by the majority of professional
web developers. Indentation is used to easily visualize which elements are
nested within other elements.
