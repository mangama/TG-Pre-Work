<!-- HTLH Structure: HTML is organized as a collection of family tree
relationships. As you saw in the last exercise, we placed <p> tags
within <body> tags. When an elementis contained inside another element, it is
considered the child of that element. The child element is said to be nested
 inside of the parent element.-->
