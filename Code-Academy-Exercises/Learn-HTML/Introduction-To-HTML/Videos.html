  <!-- Videos: In addition to images, HTML also supports displaying videos.
  Like the <img> tag, the <video> tag requires a src attribute with a link to
  the video source. Unlike the <img> tag however, the <video> element requires
  an opening and a closing tag.
  i.e.: <video src="myVideo.mp4" width="320" height="240" controls>
  Video not supported </video>
  After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the
  size of the video displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs
  the browser to include basic video controls: pause, play and skip
-->

<!--Review:
1. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the
structure and content of a webpage.
2. Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other
HTML tags between them.
3. HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element
is the child of the enclosing parent element.
4. Any visible content should be placed within the opening and
closing <body> tags .
5. Headings and sub-headings, <h1> to <h6> tags, are used to enlarge text.
6. <p>, <span> and <div> tags specify text or blocks.
7. The <em> and <strong> tags are used to emphasize text.
8. Line breaks are created with the <br> tag.
9. Ordered lists (<ol>) are numbered and unordered lists (<ul>) are bulleted.
10. Images (<img>) and videos (<video>) can be added by linking to an existing
 source.
In the next lesson, we'll take the content that you've added to this website
 and transform it into an HTML document that's ready to go on the web!-->
